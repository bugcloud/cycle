This is a plugin for the Croogo CMS built on CakePHP.
It displays a series of records as "slides" in a "cycle" or "small 
gallery." You can add more display styles and JavaScript plugins to 
change how it looks very easily.

NOTE: You must have MeioUpload plugin for CakePHP in your Croogo 
installation. You can get the plugin from: 
http://github.com/jrbasso/MeioUpload
